=== Domain Registration

https://whois.icann.org/en/lookUP?name=linuxcnc.org


=== DNS

No cost because this service is bundled with <<forum,forum.linuxcnc.org>>
hosting.


[[wlo]]
=== www.linuxcnc.org

The webserver is hosted at DreamHost.

The actual content is maintained by the developer community.
It's stored at https://github.com/linuxcnc/wlo and built by the
<<_wlo_builder,wlo-builder>>.


[[wiki]]
=== wiki.linuxcnc.org

=== forum.linuxcnc.org

This is an instance of https://www.joomla.org/[Joomla].


=== buildbot

Builds, tests, packages the software from
https://github.com/LinuxCNC/linuxcnc, uploads to wlo.  This consists
of two fairly beefy x86/amd64 hypervisors and a couple of crappy little
ARM boards.

Running an instance of http://buildbot.net/[buildbot].


=== wlo-builder

This is a VM running on the same hardware that runs the buildbot.

It builds the website from https://github.com/LinuxCNC/wlo using Jekyll,
uploads to wlo (via rsync with a special-purpose ssh key).

We use a github Webhook to poke a
https://github.com/LinuxCNC/wlo/blob/master/scripts/post-receive.cgi[CGI
script] on the wlo-builder, which triggers the build.


=== wlo-test

This is a webserver at http://wlo-test.highlab.com that publishes
experimental (non-master) branches of the wlo git repo.


=== git repo

Our git repos are hosted on https://github.com[Github], under the
https://github.com/LinuxCNC[LinuxCNC] organization.


=== bug tracker

We use the https://github.com[Github] issue tracker.


=== #linuxcnc-board

Defunct


===  Travis CI

Should be based off github permissions


=== debian archive

Specially managed part of the wlo website.  Includes configuration files
and a gpg key.
