** Things Chris wants to remember when making releases **

1. Metawork done for all platforms:

Review the diffs since the last version to make sure everything
makes sense, was intentional, and is relfected in changelog entries.
Do not screw this up.  If you haven't been paying enough attention to
commits and the committers to know whether the changes make sense or
were intentional, reconsider whether you should be making the release
right now.  Your signing the package means you know what's in it.

Use dch and make sure the changelog entries and time and email
stamps are right

Update VERSION file and check it and the new debian/changelog in

Tag cvs with the appropriate RELEASE_2_1_x.  Make sure the tags
match what's going in the binary packages.  Don't screw this up
either.  Doing support without knowing what code someone is running
is unnecessarily painful.

2. Actual release building, done separately for each platform:

Rename the source directory to emc2-2.1.x so debuild doesn't complain
when it builds the source package (sometimes dch does this for you?)

In the source directory, run dh_clean and make sure there's no
kruft in the debian directory (it should be 1.5MB, not 20MB)

In the debian directory, ./configure 2.6.15-magma

Back in the source directory, run debuild

Stick the two resulting binary packages and the two resulting source
files into the apt repository in the right place.

Repeat steps starting at #2 for dapper-sim (./configure sim) and breezy
(./configure 2.6.12-magma).  For breezy you'll have to be on a breezy
machine or a good approximation of one.

Sign and upload/rsync the apt repository

Update /topic on irc, send an announcement email containing the changelog

If you get bored it's customary to type "build build build" or "upload
upload upload" as appropriate into irc.

Change VERSION to say pre-2.1.x++ and check it in.
