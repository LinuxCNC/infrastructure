** Things to remember when making releases **

1. Metawork done for all platforms:

Review the diffs since the last version to make sure everything
makes sense, was intentional, and is reflected in changelog entries.
Do not screw this up.  If you haven't been paying enough attention to
commits and the committers to know whether the changes make sense or
were intentional, reconsider whether you should be making the release
right now.  Your signing the package means you know what's in it.

Use dch and make sure the changelog entries and time and email
stamps are right

Update VERSION file and commit it and the new debian/changelog

Tag (git tag -s) with the appropriate v2.x.y.  Make sure the tags match
what's going in the binary packages.  Don't screw this up either.  Doing
support without knowing what code someone is running is unnecessarily
painful.

Push the tag.

2. Actual release building, done separately for each platform:

Use the emc2.4-release script to build source and binary packages for
each supported operating system release.  For different architectures on
the same operating system release and with the same realtime kernel
version, use the source package generated from the first architecture
to build the package for the second architecture (don't build a second
source package).

Use the repo_get script to get changes made by another release manager
from the package server.

Stick the two resulting binary packages and the two resulting source
files into the apt repository in the right place.

Use the repo_put script to upload the new packages without updated
metadata.

Use the buildrepo script to update and sign the metadata.

Use the repo_put script a second time to upload the new metadata.
The packages are now available.

Update /topic on irc, send an announcement email containing the
changelog, update the wiki.

If you get bored it's customary to type "build build build" or "upload
upload upload" as appropriate into irc.
