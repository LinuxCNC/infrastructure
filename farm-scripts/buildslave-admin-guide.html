EMC2 Buildbot: Buildslave Admin's Guide
</h2>
</center>

<p>This document describes how to set up a <a
href="http://buildbot.net">Buildbot</a> buildslave for EMC2.

<p>Running a buildslave requires only a computer that
can check out and compile the emc2 GIT repo, can run
<a href="http://twistedmatrix.com/trac/">twisted</a> <a
href="http://www.python.org/">python</a>, and can make outgoing TCP
connections to the <a href="http://emc2-buildbot.colorado.edu">buildmaster
computer</a>.

    <li>

        <p>Disable the screensaver or set it to only blank the screen
        (so as not to soak up CPU cycles with useless fancy eye candy).

    </li>


    <li>

        <p>Make a user to run the buildslave.  It is not a good idea to
        run the buildslave as yourself.  I'll refer to the user as just
        "the buildslave user" in this document.  You can name the user
        anything you want.  Give this user a sneaky password that only
        you know.

    </li>


    <li>

        <p>Install 'ntp' (so the time will be right), and 'lsb-release'
        (so the buildslave can describe itself), and 'fakeroot' (so the
        buildslave can build the debian package):

        <p><tt>apt-get install ntp lsb-release fakeroot</tt>

    </li>


    <li>

        <p>Do an anonymous Git checkout as the buildslave user (in a
        throw-away directory out of the way) to make sure sure you can,
        and to make sure you have the ssh hostkey of the Git server
        machine.

        <p><tt>git clone git://git.linuxcnc.org/git/emc2.git emc2-dev</tt>

    </li>


    <li>

        <p>Install the emc2 build dependencies:

        <p><tt>apt-get install build-essential</tt>

        <p><tt>cd debian; ./configure sim; cd ..</tt>

        <p><tt>dpkg-checkbuilddeps</tt>

        <p><tt>apt-get install $SIM_REQUIREMENTS</tt>

        <p><tt>cd debian; ./configure -r; cd ..</tt>

        <p><tt>dpkg-checkbuilddeps</tt>

        <p><tt>apt-get install $REALTIME_REQUIREMENTS</tt>

    </li>


    <li>

        <p>Install a recent version of buildbot.  0.7.6 is too old and
        doesnt work well with Git; 0.7.9 is known to work.  Versions
        between those are unknown.

        <p>The buildbot packages in Ubuntu Intrepid and Debian Lenny
        are new enough that they Just Work:

        <p><tt>apt-get install buildbot</tt>

        <p>Ubuntu Hardy has buildbot 0.7.6, which is too old.  If your
        buildslave is Hardy or older, you need to install buildbot from
        somewhere other than the default Ubuntu repository.  The 0.7.9-1
        buildbot.deb from Intrepid is known to install and work on Hardy.

    </li>


    <li>

        <p>Now we're ready to set up the buildslave itself.  You will
        need two pieces of information from the buildmaster admin:
        the slave name and the slave password.  Ask for this on the
        emc-devel mailing list.

        <p>The slave name is just a unique identifier for your buildslave.
        It should ideally be descriptive of the environment that you're
        building on, for example "hardy-rtai-x86".

        <p>The slave password is totally unrelated to the Unix login
        password of the buildslave user.

        <p><tt>mkdir ~/BuildBot/slave/$SLAVE_NAME</tt>

        <p><tt>buildbot create-slave ~/BuildBot/slave/$SLAVE_NAME emc2-buildbot.colorado.edu:51332 $SLAVE_NAME $SLAVE_PASSWORD</tt>

        <p>(The buildslave directory above is just a suggestion, you can put it anywhere you like.)

    </li>


    <li>

        <p>On Ubuntu releases from Dapper through Lucid, the
        buildbot package provides an init script that starts the
        buildslave automatically on system boot.  This script sources
        /etc/default/buildbot, so you need to fill it out with the
        particulars of your setup.

        <p>On other distros, buildbot may be started differently.

    </li>


    <li>

        <p>Edit the <tt>info/admin</tt> and <tt>info/host</tt> files in
        your buildslave directory (<tt>~/BuildBot/slave/$SLAVE_NAME</tt>
        in the example above).  <tt>admin</tt> should have
        your name and email address, and <tt>host</tt>
        should have a brief description of your host.
        For some examples (minus the email addresses), see the <a
        href="http://emc2-buildbot.colorado.edu/buildbot/buildslaves">BuildSlave</a>
        page.

    </li>


    <li>

        <p><b>This step is optional!</b>

        <p>If you want your buildslave to run the real-time test suite, you need to do two more things:

        <ol>

            <li>

                <p>You must let the buildslave user run a couple of
                sudo commands without passwords.  The first is "sudo
                /usr/bin/make setuid" which enables the setuid bit on a
                couple of helper programs, without this the tests wont be
                able to load kernel modules.  The second sudo command is
                "sudo /bin/dmesg -c" which clears the dmesg log, this is
                done before running the tests so that the dmesg reported
                after the tests finish contains just the info for this
                test run.

                <p>Add this line to /etc/sudoers:

                <p><tt>buildslave-user ALL = ALL, NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/make setuid , /bin/dmesg -c</tt>

            </li>


            <li>

                <p>You need to allow the buildslave user to lock
                more memory than the default configuration allows.
                If you're starting buildbot from the init scripts at
                system boot, the easiest way to do this is to add this
                line to /etc/default/buildbot:

                <p><tt>ulimit -l unlimited</tt>

            </li>

        </ol>

    </li>


    <li>

        <p><b>This step is optional!</b>

        <p>If you want your buildslave to build debs, you need to set up a pbuilder chroot.

    </li>

</ol>


<hr>

<p>That's it!  I can't believe it was so easy!</p>
