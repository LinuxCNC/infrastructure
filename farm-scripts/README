Compile farm setup notes

I hope to eventually make it possible for anyone to host a compile farm "slot".
(I use the term slot because thats how the blades in the current compile farm
are labeled, but any ordinary PC could serve as a "slot".)

Security issues:

The farm should be run by a normal user.  It can be either your normal account on
the box, or an account dedicated to farm operations (the latter is more secure).

An unavoidable function of the farm is to download a configure script from CVS
and run it on the local machine without human intervention.  If someone commits
a trojan configure script to CVS, it will run on the farm machine within 5 to
10 minutes of the commit.  So you do _NOT_ want to be running the farm as root.
In addition, the farm user should not be able to use passwordless sudo or any
other trick to escalate privliges.  (NOTE: a number of BDI distros come with
passwordless sudo by default, which is very insecure.  I solved this on my farm
slots by completely disabling sudo - I changed the permissions (as root) on
the sudo binary making it impossible to execute.  If I need to be root for
admin on the box I use su and give the root password.


First, install all needed applications:

SSH client: openssh
  Need to be able to ssh into jmkasunich@linuxcnc.org without entering
  a password.  I did that by copying my private key to all the farm slots,
  so they would all be "me", then logging in (with a password) and appending
  my public key "id_rsa.pub" to "~/.ssh/authorized_keys".  (Note, .ssh 
  should have permissions 700, files in it, 600.)  If other people are
  going to set up farm slots, this will need changed.  One possibility
  is for them to send me their key and I add it to authorized_keys, but
  that gives them total access to my shell account on linuxcnc.org.  Better
  would be to set up a user account dedicated to the farm.  It might also
  be possible to use ssh configuration to limit them to doing specific 
  things.

Command line HTTP client: wget

CVS client: cvs

EMAIL sender: esmtp

  Install esmtp.  If a binary esmtp package isn't available:
     Download libesmtp from http://www.stafford.uklinux.net/libesmtp/download.html
     Download esmtp from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=63404
     configure, make, and sudo make install libesmtp first
     On some systems, you need to set up the shared libesmtp library:
	after building and installing libesmtp, find libesmtp.so.5
	(usually in /usr/local/lib)
	sudo ldconfig <dir-where-libesmtp.so.5-is-installed>
     Then configure, make, and make install esmtp

  Create .esmtprc in your home directory and add the following text:

    # Compile farm configuration file for ESMTP.
    #
    # Set SMTP host and service (port)
    hostname = mail.linuxcnc.org:587
    #
    # Set the user name
    username = USERNAME
    #
    # Set the password
    password = PASSWORD

  Change USERNAME and PASSWORD to the name and password of your email
  account on the linuxcnc.org server (contact SWPadnos for an account).
  Change the permissions on .esmtprc to 600.

Next, install optional applications:

System Clock tool: ntpdate
  The farm scripts can optionally use ntpdate to keep the system time
  sychronized with the rest of the world.  Since compile farm reports
  are timestamped, it gets confusing if the time drifts.  And since 
  compile farm slots are often left on for a very long time, and aren't
  used for much of anything else, they can and do drift, sometimes by
  hours.  Using virtual machines makes it even worse, since a VM can 
  be suspended and restarted hours or weeks later, causing a huge 
  clock error.  (Note: the NTP daemon 'ntpd' can also be used to keep
  a system synced with clock time, but it should not be used on VMs 
  that might get suspended because it could get very confused when 
  you resume.)


Next, check out the farm scripts:

  $ cvs -z5 -d:ext:anon@cvs.linuxcnc.org:/cvs co -d farm infrastructure/farm-scripts

Switch to farm directory

  $ cd farm

Check out the build trees

  $ cvs -z5 -d:ext:anon@cvs.linuxcnc.org:/cvs co -d emc2head emc2
  $ cvs -z5 -d:ext:anon@cvs.linuxcnc.org:/cvs co -d emc2.2branch -r v2_2_branch emc2

For some reason, if you are in a cvs directory (the farm directory) and do
a checkout, CVS wants to add the newly checked out tree to the top level
(making it part of the farm checkout).  This would cause a cvs update in
the top level farm directory to start recursing down into the individual 
checkouts, which is NOT good.  Fortunately we can deal with it.  When you
do the checkout, CVS doesn't actually add it right away, it just places
some cvs add commands in CVS/Entries.Log:

  $ cat CVS/Entries.Log
  A D/emc2head////
  A D/emc2.2branch////c

The cure is very easy - delete CVS/Entries.Log

  $ rm CVS/Entries.Log

Create files with the system name and slot number:

  $ echo "Ubuntu 5.10" >sysname
  $ echo "6" >slot

Create a file telling the system what trees to build:

  $ echo emc2head >trees
  $ echo emc2.2branch >>trees

Copy build scripts into the checkout directories:

  $ cp emc2_build emc2head/farm_build
  $ cp emc2_build emc2.2branch/farm_build

EMC2 currently has 2 build scripts, one that builds the normal realtime
version, and one that builds the non-realtime simulator.  If you need
special build options (passed to ./configure for example), make a slot
specific build script, and commit it to the infrastructure/farm-scripts
tree.  (Note that the need for such a script might be considered a bug, and
it would be better to solve the problem in a way that lets the same build
instructions be used for all systems.)

Optional:  only if you want to use ntpdate to keep system time synced

  First: need to be able to run "sudo ntpdate" without it pausing to
  enter a password.  Add the following line near the end of /etc/sudoers:

    username localhost = NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/ntpdate

  'username' needs to be changed to the name of the user who will be
  running the farm scripts, and /usr/sbin/ntpdate may need to be changed
  to point to wherever ntpdate is installed.

  Second: need to tell the farm scripts to use ntpdate, and what server
  to use for the time:

    echo pool.ntp.org >ntpserver

  You can (and should) use a local server if you have another system on
  your local network that is running ntpd.  Just substitute the hostname
  of your local ntp server for 'pool.ntp.org'.  If you don't want the 
  scripts to invoke ntpdate, just remove the file 'ntpserver'.

Start the scripts:

  $ ./run_farm

That's it!
