<h2>Results of latest automated compile tests</h2>

<h4>First of the 'new' farm slots is online - see NEWS below</h4>

<p>Clicking on the last build date in the tables below will take you to the 
associated log file so you can see what happened.  Clicking on the system 
name will show you a history of all builds on that system.</p>

<h3>EMC2: HEAD</h3>
<p>The EMC2 tree is the focus of new development.  The head of the tree is the mainstream
version of EMC2.  Other branches are used for experimental work, things that will break the
main tree, or variations that need to remain independent of the main tree for one reason
or another.</p>

<h3>EMC2: V2.0 Branch</h3>

<h2>Compile Farm News</h3>
<em>25-Nov-2006</em><br>
<p>The first virtual compile farm slot is online.  It is a VMWare
virtual machine, running on my main PC.  The guest OS is Ubuntu
5.10 (breezy), without any realtime patches.  It only builds CVS
HEAD, because version 2.0.x doesn't support non-realtime simulation.
</p>

<em>17-Nov-2006</em><br>
<p>Slot 2 died... the ancient 2G SCSI disk
started losing blocks.  We're only a few weeks from moving to a new 
farm using virtual machines, and we have also decided to stop 
supporting the very old systems, so I'm not going to attempt to 
rebuild that slot.</p>
<p>The log file shows 1104 builds of EMC2 on slot 2 since November 2005.
(Thats when I started logging historical results.)  The farm has actually
been running since April 2004, and it also built EMC1, RCSLIB, and the
EMC2.0 branch, so it probably has several thousand builds under its belt.
Not bad for a system that was already 5 or 6 years old when I literally
dragged it out of a trash box.</p>

<em>27-Oct-2006</em><br>
<p>"Slot 7" wasn't really a slot on the rack, it was running on my main
PC.  I just upgraded to Dapper, so this slot is no longer running.  I
am planning to move the entire farm to virtual machines running on the
main PC over the next month or two.  The plan is to have slots for
Ubuntu Dapper and Breezy, and BDI-4.xx.  I also want to have at least
one slot building the simulator version on a system with no realtime.
The older systems (BDI-2, BDI-TNG, and BDI-Live) will no longer be
supported.<p>

<em>17-Apr-2006</em><br>
<p>Major revisions to the farm scripts.  In addition to sending the 
results to the webpage, they now send failure notices to the #emc
IRC channel, and to the emc-commit mailing list.  The old approach 
wasn't very effective - sometimes a problem wouldn't be noticed 
because people weren't regularly checking the webpage, and it would
become a major task to go back and figure out exactly what change
broke the build.</p>
<p>The new scripts are also a lot more modular, and I finally got
around to writing a README that covers the steps needed to set up
a farm slot from scratch.  The farm scripts are also now stored
in a directory on our nice new CVS server.</p>
<p>Removed EMC and RCSLIB from the farm.  EMC(1) and RCSLIB don't
work on 2.6 kernels because of the new kbuild system and other
extensive changes.  We're not doing any new work on EMC(1) anyway,
and we're certainly not going to spend the time and effort it
would take to get it running on 2.6 systems.<p>
<p>Out with the old, in with the new.... along with new scripts,
we now have a new target.  The farm is now regularly building the
v2_0_branch, which will eventually be released as version 2.0.0 
of EMC.</p>

<em>22-Nov-2005</em><br>
<p>I modified the farm scripts to keep a historical record of the
pass/fail results from each build.  A single line containing the
date, time, and result, is appended to a file after each build, and
the file is accessible from the webpage.<p>
