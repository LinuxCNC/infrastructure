<h2>Results of latest automated compile tests</h2>

<h4>All of the 'new' farm slots are online - see NEWS below</h4>

<p>Clicking on the last build date in the tables below will take you to the 
associated log file so you can see what happened.  Clicking on the system 
name will show you a history of all builds on that system.</p>

<h3>EMC2: HEAD</h3>
<p>The EMC2 tree is the focus of new development.  The head of the tree is the mainstream
version of EMC2.  Other branches are used for experimental work, things that will break the
main tree, or variations that need to remain independent of the main tree for one reason
or another.</p>

<h3>EMC 2.2 Branch</h3>
<p>The v2_2_branch is the stable release branch for version 2.2.  At this time it is
only getting bugfixes, as we prepare for the release of version 2.3.0.</p>

<h3>EMC 2.1 Branch</h3>
<p>The v2_1_branch is the stable release branch for version 2.1.  At this time it is

<h3>EMC 2.0 Branch</h3>
<p>The v2_0_branch is the stable release branch for version 2.0.x (currently 2.0.5).
At this time it is only getting bugfixes.  Because version 2.0 did not include
the non-realtime simulator, we don't attempt to build on slot 1.</p>

<h2>Compile Farm News</h3>

<em>11-Nov-2007</em><br>
<p>Added the EMC-2.2 branch.  I should probably remove EMC-2.0 as well.  Maybe later.
</p>

<em>17-Jun-2007</em><br>
<p>The farm is faster now.  I've moved the virtual machines to my new
computer, a Core2 Duo with 2G of RAM.  The old computer with only 512M
would get into a serious thrash-fest if multiple builds were going on
at once, sometimes taking up to 45 minutes to finish.  The new one
takes 2-3 minutes max.  Mostly thanks to plenty of RAM, but I'm sure
the CPU helps.
</p>

<em>3-Dec-2006</em><br>
<p>Turned off slots 3 thru 5.  My basement is really quiet now.  
According to the logs, each of those slots compiled CVS head about
1200 times over the last 13 months or so.
</p>

<em>2-Dec-2006</em><br>
<p>The rest of the new compile farm slots are online.</p>
<p>Slot 6 is a VMware virtual machine running BDI-4.51.  It requires
non-standard build scripts, because of various weirdness in the BDI 
kernel and system configuration (configure needs help to find RTAI).
</p>
<p>Slot 7 is not a virtual machine.  It is a dedicated user account on
my main Ubuntu 6.06 LTS (dapper) machine (which has a realtime kernel).
</p>
<p>Slots 3, 4, and 5 are living on borrowed time - I will be shutting
them down one of these days.
</p>

<em>25-Nov-2006</em><br>
<p>The version 2.1 branch has been created, and the new compile farm
slots are now building it.</p>

<em>25-Nov-2006</em><br>
<p>The first two virtual compile farm slots are online.  They are VMWare
virtual machines, running on my main PC.</p>
<p>Slot 1 is running Ubuntu
5.10 (breezy), without any realtime patches.  It only builds CVS
HEAD, because version 2.0.x doesn't support non-realtime simulation.</p>
<p>
Slot 2 is also running Ubuntu Breezy, but it has the realtime kernel
and is building a complete EMC, both HEAD and the version 2.0 branch.
</p>

<em>17-Nov-2006</em><br>
<p>Slot 2 died... the ancient 2G SCSI disk
started losing blocks.  We're only a few weeks from moving to a new 
farm using virtual machines, and we have also decided to stop 
supporting the very old systems, so I'm not going to attempt to 
rebuild that slot.</p>
<p>The log file shows 1104 builds of EMC2 on slot 2 since November 2005.
(Thats when I started logging historical results.)  The farm has actually
been running since April 2004, and it also built EMC1, RCSLIB, and the
EMC2.0 branch, so it probably has several thousand builds under its belt.
Not bad for a system that was already 5 or 6 years old when I literally
dragged it out of a trash box.</p>

<em>27-Oct-2006</em><br>
<p>"Slot 7" wasn't really a slot on the rack, it was running on my main
PC.  I just upgraded to Dapper, so this slot is no longer running.  I
am planning to move the entire farm to virtual machines running on the
main PC over the next month or two.  The plan is to have slots for
Ubuntu Dapper and Breezy, and BDI-4.xx.  I also want to have at least
one slot building the simulator version on a system with no realtime.
The older systems (BDI-2, BDI-TNG, and BDI-Live) will no longer be
supported.<p>

<em>17-Apr-2006</em><br>
<p>Major revisions to the farm scripts.  In addition to sending the 
results to the webpage, they now send failure notices to the #emc
IRC channel, and to the emc-commit mailing list.  The old approach 
wasn't very effective - sometimes a problem wouldn't be noticed 
because people weren't regularly checking the webpage, and it would
become a major task to go back and figure out exactly what change
broke the build.</p>
<p>The new scripts are also a lot more modular, and I finally got
around to writing a README that covers the steps needed to set up
a farm slot from scratch.  The farm scripts are also now stored
in a directory on our nice new CVS server.</p>
<p>Removed EMC and RCSLIB from the farm.  EMC(1) and RCSLIB don't
work on 2.6 kernels because of the new kbuild system and other
extensive changes.  We're not doing any new work on EMC(1) anyway,
and we're certainly not going to spend the time and effort it
would take to get it running on 2.6 systems.<p>
<p>Out with the old, in with the new.... along with new scripts,
we now have a new target.  The farm is now regularly building the
v2_0_branch, which will eventually be released as version 2.0.0 
of EMC.</p>

<em>22-Nov-2005</em><br>
<p>I modified the farm scripts to keep a historical record of the
pass/fail results from each build.  A single line containing the
date, time, and result, is appended to a file after each build, and
the file is accessible from the webpage.<p>
